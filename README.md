# This project was created for the Hack@CEWIT 2020 hackathon
It is not pretty, feature-rich, or usable outside of specific circumstances. I apologise for any mistakes or spaghetti code, this project was built in less than 48 hours and does not have the same polish as projects I would normally code.

This project was built with a team of 5 people, Bob Sprowl, Ken Morales, Kyle Danielson, Sarah Andraka, and myself. This was one of the best hackathons I've done and is a project I am very proud of. Sarah and I have built the main functionality of the application, locking the device drivers, while Bob and Ken created the notification portion. This was first project where I lead the development alongside Sarah and worked with multiple people on the same project. This is very much shown in the messy code but it came together for a great project and an even better learning experience.
